# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This day planner is specifically targeted towards working individuals who have trouble managing their time. The planner is split up into 8 different sections, each corresponding to one hour of time in a 9h-17h work day. Daily tasks can be saved to this planner in order to help manage time and stay ontop of deadlines.

## Installation

No installation required, navigate to https://michaelsinn.github.io/day-planner/ to use the day planner.

## Usage

To use the day planner, navigate to https://michaelsinn.github.io/day-planner/. Once on the site, enter your hourly tasks by clicking on the center of a table row and typing. After the desired task has been added, make sure to press the save button for that row. Without pressing save, your tasks will be removed when you refresh or exit the page. Grey rows represent past time, red rows represent current time, and green rows represent future times.

The planner is setup to use 24 hour time.
